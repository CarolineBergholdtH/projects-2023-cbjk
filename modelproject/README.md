# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **OLG model** and is about the OLG model shown in the lectures. Our version has only a Cobb.Douglas production function. We have expanded the model to include population and technology growth. Further, we have implemented the pay as you go (PAYG) scheme. Additionally, we look at firm profits, tax revenue and government debt. Lastly, we look at the utility of each of the models. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
